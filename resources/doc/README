3. About
--------

@name@ is a citygml4j module for the CityGML 2.0 Energy
Application Domain Extension (ADE). It currently implements the "KIT Profile"
of the EnergyADE.

The module is implemented against the ADEContext extension of citygml4j.
In contrast to the generic ADE support of citygml4j, which maps ADE content 
onto a Java DOM representation, the ADEContext approach allows for extending 
the citygml4j object model with new ADE classes. JAXB is used for parsing and 
writing ADE-enriched CityGML datasets. The required JAXB classes mapping the 
ADE XML Schema can easily be generated with the ade-xjc compiler shipped with 
citygml4j.

@name@ is part of the citygml4j project.


4. System requirements
----------------------

* Java JRE or JDK >= @javaCompatibility@
* citygml4j v@citygml4jVersion@ to use the module


5. How to use it
----------------

Simply build a JAR file of the @name@ using the Gradle build
script.

In order to develop a EnergyADE application, put the @name@ library
together with citygml4j on your classpath. In your code, register the
module with the citygml4j library through the CityGMLContext class. This
makes the ADE module known to citygml4j. Once registered, the module will be 
automatically used in parsing, processing and writing ADE-enriched datasets.
